										<h4>Last Updated: July 29, 2025</h4>
										<p>Thank you for using the Astrological and Numerological Blueprint Calculator. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use our service, why we collect it, and how it is handled. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our data practices.</p>
										<h4>1. Information We Collect</h4>
										<p>When you use the calculator, we collect the following information that you voluntarily provide:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Name:</strong> The name you enter for the chart calculation.</li>
											<li><strong>Birth Information:</strong> The date of birth (year, month, day) and time of birth (hour, minute) you provide.</li>
											<li><strong>Location Information:</strong> The birth location (e.g., "Boston, MA, USA") you enter.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect your IP address or any other information that is not explicitly entered into the form fields.</p>
										<h4>2. How We Use Your Information</h4>
										<p>The information you provide is used for the following purposes:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>To Perform Calculations:</strong> The data is sent to our secure server to perform the astrological and numerological calculations and generate your personalized report.</li>
											<li><strong>To Generate AI Readings:</strong> Anonymized astrological data (your planetary positions, but not your name, date, time, or location) is sent to the Google Gemini API to generate the "AI Astrological Synthesis" portion of your report.</li>
											<li><strong>Application Monitoring & Debugging:</strong> The input data is sent to a secure, third-party logging service (Better Stack) for the sole purpose of monitoring application performance, identifying bugs, and troubleshooting errors.</li>
											<li><strong>Research and Service Improvement:</strong> Birth data may be used to analyze astrological patterns, conduct research, and train artificial intelligence designed to improve the accuracy and depth of our astrological readings and to further the study of astrology.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h4>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Storage:</strong> The birth data you provide is stored in two ways: (1) It is logged in our secure, third-party application monitoring service (Better Stack) for the purposes of debugging and ensuring the calculator functions correctly. (2) The data may be exported and stored securely in private documents (e.g., spreadsheets) for the sole purpose of future astrological research, as described in Section 2.</li>
											<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> We are committed to protecting your privacy. We will not sell or rent your personal information. We only share data with the essential third-party services described in this policy (such as our geocoding, logging, and AI providers) that are required for the calculator to function. Anonymized astrological data is processed by Google's services to provide the AI reading, subject to their privacy policies.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>4. Your Rights and Data Deletion</h4>
										<p>You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data from our logs and research documents. If you would like to have your information removed, please contact us with the details of the data you entered (name, date, location), and we will permanently delete the corresponding entries.</p>
										<h4>5. Consent for Research Use</h4>
										<p>By using this calculator, you acknowledge and consent that the birth data you provide may be stored and used for the research and potential artificial intelligence training purposes described in Section 2 and 3. This is essential for helping us learn more about astrology and improve the quality of the service we provide to you and other users.</p>
										<h4>6. Contact Us</h4>
										<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to request the deletion of your data, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:synthesisastrology@outlook.com"><strong>synthesisastrology@outlook.com</strong></a></p>
