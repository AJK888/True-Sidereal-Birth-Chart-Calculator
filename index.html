										<h2>Your Astrological Blueprint</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Astrology is a powerful tool for insight and self-development. This platform combines modern technology with ancient wisdom to provide a comprehensive, dual-zodiac analysis of your unique birth chart, offering a richer and more complete picture of your personality and life path.</p>
									<h4>What You’ll Receive:</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>A comprehensive professional reading powered by a multi-step artificial intelligence analysis.</li>
										<li>Visual chart wheels for both your Sidereal and Tropical charts, displayed side-by-side.</li>
										<li>Full planetary placements for both zodiacs, allowing you to explore the difference between your soul's blueprint (Sidereal) and its expression in this lifetime (Tropical).</li>
										<li>A detailed analysis of key aspects, planetary patterns, and chart dominance.</li>
										<li>Your personal Numerology and Chinese Zodiac sign.</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Explore the Difference:</h4>
									<p>The Sidereal system aligns with the observable night sky, offering a more astronomically accurate perspective on your soul's karmic path. The Tropical system, based on the seasons, reveals how these energies manifest in your personality. By exploring both systems side by side, you gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of who you are.</p>

									<summary>Please use your Personal Discernment while Exploring Occult Divination Practices:</summary>
									<div>
										<h4>Religious Perspectives on Divination:</h4>
										<p>The Catholic Church, Islam, and Judaism all strongly discourage or reject divination, viewing it as an attempt to divert trust away from God. These faiths emphasize that seeking knowledge of the future through supernatural means is contrary to divine providence. Instead, they advocate for believers to place their trust in God’s plan, seeking guidance through prayer, faith, and divine revelation.</p>
										<h4>A Warning on the Occult:</h4>
										<p>Many occult practices, such as tarot readings, psychic readings, crystal gazing, and Ouija boards, provide accurate information. However, I believe that this knowledge does not originate from divine sources. Instead, it may be influenced by spiritual forces that are not aligned with God’s will, which you are inviting into your life.</p>
										<h4>Astrology and Numerology:</h4>
										<p>Astrology and numerology, are distinct from other occult practices. They are grounded in the observation of natural patterns in God’s creation. Because they focus on natural phenomena, astrology and numerology do not appear to invite harmful spiritual influences, as they are rooted in the study of God's design and order in the universe.</p>
										<h4>Why I Practice Astrology:</h4>
										<p>I believe astrology, when practiced responsibly and with respect, can be a valuable tool for personal growth and spiritual development. By gaining insight from our natal charts, astrology helps us understand our tendencies, strengths, and challenges. This understanding encourages us to align our actions with God’s will and guide us toward a life of greater peace, purpose, and fulfillment.</p>
										<p>Astrology also offers a path to recognizing the divine gifts we’ve been given, helping us identify and nurture them to serve others with authenticity and grace. By understanding our astrological chart, we can become more attuned to our purpose in life, cultivating virtues such as love, patience, humility, and wisdom, which draw us closer to God and help us live more fully in accordance with His plan.</p>
										<h4>Commitment to Integrity:</h4>
										<p>I am deeply committed to God and remain open to reevaluating my views on astrology with careful reflection. If I ever receive new insights that challenge my approach or feel uncomfortable with how this website is being used, I will take the necessary steps to ensure it aligns with my values and beliefs.</p>
