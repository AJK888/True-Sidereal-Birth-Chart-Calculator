## 🚀 Phase 12: Final Optimizations & Production Hardening

### Goals:
- Final performance optimizations (response times, memory, queries, cache)
- Production hardening (error recovery, graceful degradation, circuit breakers, retry logic)
- Additional integrations (webhooks, third-party services, API integrations, fallbacks)
- Code quality & maintenance (cleanup, documentation, type hints, consistency)
- Security enhancements (headers, input sanitization, rate limiting, audit)
- Monitoring & observability (logging, metrics, alerting, dashboards)
